# TickTheTasks
"TickTheTasks" is a web app to help manage ongoing projects requiring a follow-up on many tasks to be done!

It is built using the holy trinity: Javascript, HTML and CSS. 
Webpack was used for modules bundling. To store the users data, localStorage was implemented. Finally, date manipulation was simplified with the date-fns library.
